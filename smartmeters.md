# Smart Meters and Energy Monitoring Technologies

The following diagram is meant to situate smart meters in a broader context and to illustrate some of the benefits and concerns that have been articulated, what some say the future of this divices might look like, and briefly explain (to my understanding) some of the component parts that make up the system. [Online version] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0S3ThDucO4MNGF2V29vS1A5eXc/view?usp=sharing) of the diagram contains links to relevant articles.

## NILM
NILM is a unique process for analyzing changes in the current and voltage going into a setup and measuring the individual energy consumption and load of the devices being used in the premises. The derivations are based on consumed load, duration of usage, peak usage pattern, etc. NILM use smart meters. 

## Smart Meters
Smart meters play a fundamental role in the smart grid. These sensors provide 2 way communication between utility provider and consumer. An particularly important fact is that smart meters not only allow for sensing and tracking of energy, but for remote connection and disconnection. 

Today, the smart sensing technologies (hardware, software, protocols, international standards etc.) are still in development. But simultaneously, other companies are building on top of this technology applications that can add value to the data these sensors collect. Smart analytics, behavioral feedback, actionable intelligence are all services that companies offer to consumers. However, others like IBM believe the future of smart meters as an IoT involve cognitive capabilities.
